It addresses how hospitals, biobanks, and healthcare providers in Germany—and across Europe—manage patient information under GDPR regulations. Central issues include informed consent, data processing, and privacy, especially concerning genetic data, diagnoses, and therapy documentation. The debate involves balancing individual rights such as autonomy and self-determination against collective goals like medical research, public health, and healthcare system efficiency. Key challenges include ensuring data security, transparency, and trust while avoiding discrimination, economic exploitation, or unequal access to care.Ethics committees, legal frameworks, and interdisciplinary efforts (involving medicine, law, bioethics, and technology) play a crucial role in developing responsible standards. The discussion reflects broader themes such as justice, inclusion, professional responsibility, and digital transformation within healthcare and society.\"\n",
